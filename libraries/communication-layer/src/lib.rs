//! Abstraction of various publisher/subscriber communication backends.
//!
//! Provides a [`CommunicationLayer`] trait as an abstraction for different publisher/subscriber
//! systems. The following set of backends are currently supported:
//!
//! - **[Zenoh](https://zenoh.io/):** The zenoh project implements a distributed
//!   publisher/subscriber system with automated routing. To use zenoh, use the
//!   [`ZenohCommunicationLayer`][zenoh::ZenohCommunicationLayer] struct.
//! - **[Iceoryx](https://iceoryx.io/):** The Eclipse iceoryxâ„¢ project provides an IPC middleware
//!   based on shared memory. It is very fast, but it only supports local communication. To use
//!   iceoryx, use the [`IceoryxCommunicationLayer`][iceoryx::IceoryxCommunicationLayer] struct.
