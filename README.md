Dataflow Oriented Robotic Architecture

## Python API Design

The Python API is probably going to look as follows:
```python
@register
async def function_name(state: DoraState, message: DoraMessage):
    return outputs
``` 

The philosophy is to use async function as primary instance to:
- Mitigate the risk of running undafe data mutations.
- Managing several run at the same time with timeout / deadline capabilities
- Using Tokio Spawn to avoid thread locks on CPU bound runs.
